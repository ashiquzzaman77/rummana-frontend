                        <p class="history-para">Taqiul Ghani established the non-profit organization Project Rummana in
                            Bangladesh in 2021 as a result of the untimely death of his mother from COVID-19. He founded
                            the organization to give attention to students' mental health because he saw there was a
                            shortage of such support for them in the nation. This was proven correct after his own
                            journey of grief and lack of support from any organization. Project Rummana, which is named
                            after his mother Rummana, seeks to address various mental health issues among students by
                            providing workshops, counseling, and treatment. Through its steadfast dedication, the
                            organization has made a positive difference in the lives of over 5,000 students and actively
                            promotes a culture in which everyone had access to mental health resources. The
                            organization's expansion and advocacy for mental health support in Bangladesh were inspired
                            by Taqiul Ghani's own struggle and grief from the loss of his mother</p>

                        <p class="history-para">We are honored to introduce Brig. Gen. Md. Nasimul Gani (Retd), a

                            General Gani has exhibited exceptional interpersonal skills and intellectual engagement
                            throughout diverse strata of society, both domestically and internationally.

                            military service has been marked by unwavering patriotism, honesty, dedication, and a strong
                            moral character. These qualities have not only contributed to his distinguished career but
                            also made him an ideal advisor for our organization.

                            Having served in critical UN assignments, including Somalia UNISOM-2 (1993-94) and South
                            Sudan UNMISS (2005-06), General Gani possesses a deep understanding of global challenges and
                            the importance of mental well-being in conflict-ridden regions.

                            Furthermore, his diplomatic assignment as Defense Attaché in Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain
                            Embassies (Nov 2012–Dec 2016) showcases his ability to navigate international environments

                            General Gani's academic achievements are equally impressive. He holds a diverse educational
                            background, from SSC and HSC at Rajshahi Cadet College to a Master of Defense Studies, a
                            Master of War Studies, and even an M. Phil. and Ph.D. from Jahangir Nagar University. His
                            intellectual prowess and dedication to learning underscore his commitment to holistic
                            problem-solving.<br>

                            In the realm of publication, he has authored three books and numerous articles in various
                            military and nonmilitary journals and newspapers. He has also been an active participant in
                            multiple seminars and symposiums, both nationally and internationally, further showcasing
                            his commitment to continuous growth and knowledge sharing.

                            (Bangladesh), and the International Senior Defense Management Course (USA), reflecting his
                            dedication to professional development.

                            His vast experience, education, international exposure, and commitment to knowledge exchange
                            make him an invaluable asset to our advisory body. We are confident that his insights will
                            significantly contribute to our mission of supporting the mental health and well-being of
                            Bangladeshi students.

                        <p class="history-para">"Two years ago, I embarked on a profound mission to create Project Rummana. It was my toughest ambition as stigma and taboo is adamantly strong in our society, Bangladesh. Today, as I reflect on our journey, I am humbled and proud of the positive impact we have had on the student population of Bangladesh. 
 
                            At Project Rummana, our purpose is clear – to provide vital mental health education, resources, and awareness to the young minds of our nation. Our goal is ambitious, yet we stand determined to be the first and attempt to be the best mental health service provider in every educational facility across Bangladesh.
